# Digital Art Showcase Web App

## Introduction

The **Digital Art Showcase Web App** is an online platform where digital artists can display their artwork, and art enthusiasts can explore and purchase pieces. The app promotes a user-friendly, vibrant interface for viewing, contacting artists, and arranging purchases directly. It simplifies the process for both artists and buyers by offering an engaging digital gallery.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two key components:
1. **Landing Page**: Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It serves as the homepage, highlighting featured artists and artworks.
2. **Digital Art Gallery**: A core feature where users can browse, view, and contact artists to purchase digital art pieces.

## Features

### Landing Page

- **Featured Artists**: Showcases highlighted artists and their work.
- **Navigation**: Links to different sections of the web app.
- **Call to Action**: A prominent button guiding users to explore the gallery.

### Digital Art Gallery

- **Contact for Purchase**: Users can contact the artists directly using the provided details to arrange purchases.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for various devices, providing a seamless experience on desktop and mobile.

## How It Works

1. **Artist Submission**: Artists upload their artwork along with their contact details.
2. **User Interaction**: Users browse through the digital gallery, and if interested in purchasing, they contact the artist directly to arrange the sale.
3. **Commissions**: The app collects a commission on sales made through the platform, with clear terms outlined upfront.
